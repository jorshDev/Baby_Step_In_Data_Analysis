This chart shows COGS was highly correlated to Profit made meaning COGS is probably a causative agent for the amount of Profits made.

# Findings and Recommendation
1. 2014 had the highest sales most probably due to the high number of discounts in the same year compared to the previous.
2. Profit could be dependent on the COGS.
